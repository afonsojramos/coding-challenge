## About
The solutions implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make the best code in terms of 'quality', but I intend to have clean solutions that can be interpreted by someone other than me, however, my main objectives are solve the problems as quickly and as efficiently as required, so beware.
